# Compiling and running with only g++ or gcc (-std=c++14) or higher

Also I can suggest running on MSVC integrated system,or Clang++(7.1.0 or higher) but we tested code using g++ compiler.

# Algorithms & data structures are implemented by our team

Data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design.So our purpose is to demonstrate how can you implement yourself and use them instead of Standard template library containers. 

# STRING IMPLEMENTATION

String includes random access iterators, relational operators, input/output operator averloads, and main functionality.

# VECTOR IMPLEMENTATION

Vector also includes random access iterators, and basic functionality to work with. 

# FORWARD LIST IMPLEMENTATION

Forward list has some privelges over other containers. We provide extended functionality and forward iterators but as a Redis client you will never encounter with implementation details.

# RED-BLACK TREE (Set)

RB tree is kind of complicated height-balancing binary search tree. The re-balancing is not perfect yet. But guarantees O(logN) searching, inserting and deleting elements.

# HASH-TABLE (Map)

HashTable is also a data structure, using hash function implemented by separate chaining idiom. We don't guarantee O(1) complexity for reaching, or inserting,in case of string as a key. BUT we suggest for professionals to provide own hashing function and passing as 3rd parameter, as we provide generic class with templates
**Here is a good motivation to test your skills and surprise your colleagues.**
