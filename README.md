#Compiling and running with only g++ or gcc

Also I can suggest running on MSVC integrated system,or Clang++(7.1.0 or higher) but we tested code using g++ compiler.

#Algorithms & data structures are implemented by our team

Data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design.So our purpose is to demonstrate how can you implement yourself and use them instead of Standard template containers. 

#STRING IMPLEMENTATION

String includes random access iterators, relational operators, input/output operator averloads, and main functionality.

#VECTOR IMPLEMENTATION

Vector also includes random access iterators, and basic functionality to work with. 

#FORWARD LIST IMPLEMENTATION

Forward list has some privelges over other containers. We provide extended functionality and forward iterators but as a Redis client you will never encounter with implementation details.

#RED-BLACK TREE

RB tree is kind of complicated height-balancing binary search tree. The re-balancing is not perfect yet. But guarantees O(logN) searching, inserting and deleting elements.

#HASH-TABLE
